## This project has been made using Chat GPT and Figma only 

i don't know how to code but i can ideate and iterate on ideas well, So i decided to make a web app using python , i provided chat gpt with the sufficient prompt, then it provided me with the necessary file and the step by step instructions to follow . that's how i created the python, javascript and html part of the project

For the css the chat gpt provide me with an initial basic design and it was ugly so i decided to design a less ugly ui on figma's free version .after finishing the design i took a screenshot and put and gave it to chat gpt and told it to generate the css file for me 

Bingo the project was complete within an hour 

it's amazing that a non coder can make these kind of projects within hours using ai

*i would say you don't to learn much about the programming language though, but you will learn how to convert your ideas into reality if you have the right resources at your disposal*
